# How to start the project

Install Python if you have not done so already.

Personal recommendation is to use a venv or environment manager such as uv or poetry, 
but if you are ok with just using your global python installation that is up to you.

To run this application you need to start two terminals, one for the web frontend, and one for the python API server.

## Terminal 1: Web Frontend Server
Go to the web folder via a terminal and start the web server on port 8080 (If that one is in use by your system use another such as 5000, 5001, etc.)
```bash
cd web
python -m http.server 8080
```

This starts an HTTP server on http://localhost:8080. 
In other words the contents of the folder are accessible from that URL, and since there is an index.html inside the folder it dictates the web interface.


## Terminal 2: Python API Server

From the project root directory install the required python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create the database file

Create a `coffee.db` file and execute the statements in `init.sql` using DuckDB:

```bash
duckdb coffee.db < init.sql
```

### Start the server
Now you can start the API server, which takes a database file as argument such as `coffee.db`.
```bash
python app.py <db-file>
```
It always starts the server on port 8000, if you want to change this do it in the function `run_server()` in `app.py`.
